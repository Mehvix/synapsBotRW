# synapsBot RW
This is a WIP project for my Discord Server. This is the up-to-date version that will be using rewrite.
You can see what I plan on working on [Trello Board.](https://trello.com/b/CQBT9vag/synapsbot)

If you keep getting an error code when trying to write to the `users.json` file it's probably because you have multiple versions of the same bot running at the same time.
